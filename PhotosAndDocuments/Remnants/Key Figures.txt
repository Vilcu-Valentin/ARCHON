Dr. V. Valen was a leading figure in the study of Remnants and is credited with uncovering many of their most insidious properties. Once a rising star in anomaly research, he became a shadow of his former self after prolonged exposure to several Remnants. Valen now operates under a pseudonym, having distanced himself from ARF, though his research remains vital to understanding these objects.
