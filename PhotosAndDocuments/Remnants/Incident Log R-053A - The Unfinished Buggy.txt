A seemingly ordinary, half-finished buggy found abandoned in a garage in Romania was discovered to be a Remnant in 2020. The buggy, though incomplete, radiated an unexplainable pull on individuals who came into contact with it. At first, victims would simply tinker with the buggy, attempting to complete its construction. However, as time went on, they became obsessed with its perfection, constantly reworking its parts without ever finishing it.
    
Dr. V. Valen himself led the research on this Remnant, initially attracted to it as a personal project. Over time, Valen, along with several other researchers, found themselves spending weeks at a time trying to "finish" the buggyâ€”despite it never needing or being able to be completed. Victims would experience vivid dreams about driving the vehicle through endless hilly landscapes, while in reality, they neglected their health and well-being, trapped in a cycle of obsession. The unfinished buggy remains in containment, with no one able to determine how or why it exerts this influence or what it is truly capable of if completed.
