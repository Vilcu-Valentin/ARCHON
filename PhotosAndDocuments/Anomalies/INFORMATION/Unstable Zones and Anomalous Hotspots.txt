While anomalies are spread globally, certain regions have become **anomalous hotspots**, where Strange Energy concentrations are higher, making reality itself unstable. These zones are often the sites of mass evacuations, permanent quarantines, or complete abandonment.

Key anomalous zones include:

- **The Eastern Rift Zone**: Located in Eastern Europe, where the original Ophir Shard was first discovered. This region is riddled with gravitational distortions, sudden time loops, and spatial anomalies.

- **The Pacific Northwest Enclave**: A heavily forested area known for its luminal distortions and time dilation fields, where light behaves unpredictably, and time can shift suddenly, causing people to lose hours or even days.
