Below are some of the most infamous anomalies documented by the A.R.F. before its collapse in 1999:

- **The Ophir Shard Anomaly**: The source of Strange Energy and the origin of all subsequent anomalies. Contained within a highly secured facility before the Catalyst Incident, the Ophir Shard’s current status remains unknown after the destruction of the facility during the Decimation.

- **Remnants**: A subclass of object-based anomalies, **Remnants** are seemingly worthless, often dilapidated objects—old tools, broken radios, books with missing pages—that have absorbed Strange Energy. These items have a peculiar ability to **bind to individuals**, creating an increasing obsession that overtakes their lives. Victims of Remnants abandon all other aspects of life to focus on the object, often leading to their psychological or physical ruin. Despite their small size and inconspicuous nature, Remnants pose a particularly insidious threat due to their psychological influence.

- **Leviathan**: An anomaly codenamed **Leviathan** that led to the collapse of A.R.F.’s central European facility during an attempted containment operation in 1999. Leviathan is believed to be an energy-based anomaly with unpredictable and devastating effects on reality. It played a critical role in the Decimation, which resulted in the destruction of most A.R.F. facilities and personnel.
