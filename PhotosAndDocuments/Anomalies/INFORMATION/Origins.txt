The Catalyst Incident

On **March 22, 1995**, a catastrophic event now known as the **Catalyst Incident** occurred during an experimental attempt to extract energy from the **Ophir Shard Anomaly**, a seemingly limitless energy source discovered by the founders of **M&A LLC**. The extraction process was rushed and highly unstable, leading to an uncontrollable explosion that spread Strange Energy across the globe.

This energy, now understood to be a foreign force, interacted with various objects, environmental forces, and energy fields, giving rise to the anomalies. The **Anomalous Research Foundation (A.R.F.)** was established in the wake of the incident to contain and understand the new, volatile reality.
