Anomalies are objects, forces, or even natural phenomena like climate, gravity, or electromagnetic fields that have been fundamentally altered by the mysterious energy released during the **Catalyst Incident** in 1995. This energy, later dubbed **Strange Energy**, appears to interact with and alter non-biological matter in ways that defy known physics. The nature of these anomalies ranges from mildly curious to catastrophically dangerous, with effects that challenge humanity's understanding of reality.

Curiously, **anomalies do not affect biological life**â€”there are no anomalous living entities, creatures, or sentient beings. All recorded anomalies are either inanimate objects or environmental phenomena. These objects seem to lack a will or higher intelligence, instead acting as conduits for the Strange Energy, creating bizarre and often unpredictable effects in the world around them.

While anomalies are dispersed globally, they remain relatively sparse. **Anomaly density** is significantly higher in certain areas, referred to as **anomalous zones**, where reality itself seems unstable, making these regions uninhabitable. Many such zones are heavily monitored or quarantined, though they are difficult to control due to their shifting, volatile nature.
