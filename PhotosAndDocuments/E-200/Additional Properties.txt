Curiously, the anomaly prevents light from reflecting off surfaces, making reflective materials such as mirrors or glass inoperative. Only direct artificial light sources can function within E-200, resulting in an unnaturally oppressive atmosphere, as the areas appear devoid of the usual ambient light and reflections that would provide a sense of depth and space.
