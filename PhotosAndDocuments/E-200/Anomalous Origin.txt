E-200 was first reported in 1995 in a small mountain town, following an abnormal weather event that coincided with the onset of the darkness. Early hypotheses suggested a rare meteorological phenomenon, but further investigations revealed the consistent bending of light away from the region, contradicting conventional physics. Multiple regions worldwide have since reported similar occurrences, with no clear geographic pattern or cause.
