ANNEX - Observational Data

“There’s something deeply unsettling about the way light behaves here. It doesn’t reflect. It doesn’t scatter. It’s just... consumed. Even floodlights don’t work properly. You’d expect them to illuminate the entire area, but once you get past a few meters, the light just dies. I’ve never seen anything like it. The longer we stay here, the more disoriented the team gets. I’m starting to think it’s not just light this thing is affecting.”
