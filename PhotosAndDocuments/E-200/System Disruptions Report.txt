ARCHON systems recorded multiple power anomalies in digital sensors monitoring E-200-affected regions. Visual recording equipment experienced intermittent malfunctions, with cameras unable to capture footage beyond a certain distance, as light within the frame became increasingly diffused. This led to numerous unusable files, as cameras appeared to be “blinded” by the darkness surrounding the artificial light sources. Efforts to map the interior of E-200 regions have been impeded by the failure of long-range illumination devices.

Further system disruptions occurred when attempting to process satellite imagery over E-200 areas. The anomaly seems to extend into the upper atmosphere, with satellite cameras displaying areas of black void where natural light should normally reflect off clouds or the ground below. Investigation into these disruptions is ongoing, though no correlation with known atmospheric anomalies has been found.
