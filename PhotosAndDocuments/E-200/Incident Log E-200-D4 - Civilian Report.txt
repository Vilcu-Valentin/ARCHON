ANNEX - Observational Data

“It was as if the sun had just... vanished. We thought it was just an eclipse or something, but then night came, and it never got bright again. We’ve been living in this weird dusk for weeks now. Streetlights and lamps are all that’s keeping us from complete darkness. The weirdest part is that none of the windows reflect anymore. It’s like the glass just swallowed the light. I can’t see myself in mirrors, even when I hold a flashlight to my face.”
