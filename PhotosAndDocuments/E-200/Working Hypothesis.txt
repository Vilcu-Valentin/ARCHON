E-200 represents a complex interaction between **light and space**, where natural light is selectively bent or absorbed before it can illuminate the environment. The lack of reflected light suggests that the anomaly may influence the behavior of photons on a fundamental level, potentially disrupting normal physical laws within its boundaries. The absence of ambient light and reflective surfaces has also been linked to growing **psychological disorientation** among individuals exposed for prolonged periods, with early symptoms including difficulty perceiving distance and depth.

There is some evidence to suggest that E-200 may be spreading over time, though this has not been conclusively proven. The unpredictable duration of the anomaly, ranging from days to months, further complicates efforts to establish patterns or predict future occurrences.
