ANNEX

While no definitive cause for F-004 has been identified, several occurrences have been documented near fault lines and other geologically unstable regions. Initial theories linked the anomaly to tectonic shifts; however, instances far from any such activity challenge this assumption. It remains unknown whether these zones are naturally occurring phenomena or the result of an underlying anomalous force yet to be understood.

Instances of *Left-Right* have also appeared in urban and rural settings without seismic activity, further complicating research into the origin and spread of this anomaly.
