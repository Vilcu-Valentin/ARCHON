F-004 represents a direct manipulation of **localized gravitational fields**, though the underlying mechanism remains speculative. Current evidence suggests the phenomenon is non-terrestrial in origin, potentially linked to unknown forms of energy or force. Unlike traditional gravitational fluctuations, which operate on predictable patterns, F-004 shows no such consistency.

Its effect on biological entities raises concerns over long-term exposure, particularly regarding the strain it places on the human body during rapid gravitational shifts. Individuals subjected to F-004 for extended periods have shown signs of **gravitational acclimation**, though this phenomenon has yet to be studied in detail.

Preliminary research suggests the area surrounding F-004 experiences a form of **gravitational oscillation**, wherein the force fluctuates between two extremes—lightness and heaviness—hence its codename *"Left-Right."* These oscillations may be related to distortions in **spacetime fabric**, although this theory remains unverified. Efforts to map the anomaly and its spread have met with mixed success due to the unreliability of instruments within the affected zones.

Ongoing research is focused on establishing **predictive models** for F-004’s appearance and its potential relationship with tectonic stress or underground anomalies. However, until a concrete cause is identified, all encounters with F-004 are to be handled with extreme caution. Further investigation is required to assess the full scope of its influence and to determine if containment or neutralization methods are feasible.
