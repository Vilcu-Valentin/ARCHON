ANNEX 

**[DATE REDACTED]**

During a routine survey of seismic activity in a known *Left-Right* zone, multiple monitoring devices reported **corrupted readings**. Sensors detected gravitational anomalies outside standard physical parameters, leading to erratic data spikes and short system outages. Equipment recalibration failed to resolve the issue, and further analysis suggests that F-004 is capable of disrupting even non-analog systems through undetermined means. Several recording logs were found corrupted beyond recovery.

Additional research logs indicate a **gravitational pull anomaly**, suggesting that the field affected by F-004 warps data collection within the zone, rendering most sensor-based equipment unreliable during peak events. Personnel were temporarily evacuated from the area following concerns of hazardous gravitational shifts.
