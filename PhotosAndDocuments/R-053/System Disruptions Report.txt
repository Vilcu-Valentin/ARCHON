ANNEX 

**[DATE REDACTED]**

Multiple system malfunctions were reported within the ARCHON Archive during an attempt to log R-053’s transport history. Automated logging systems failed, producing incomplete entries. Recovered fragments noted that “R-053 cannot be moved” due to an unidentified gravitational pull that increased in intensity over time. Attempts to lift or disassemble the buggy met with unexplained failures, with personnel reporting equipment malfunctions or missing components. All data pertaining to these incidents was partially corrupted, requiring further investigation.

**[DATE REDACTED]**

Technicians working with digital archives of R-053 experienced localized terminal outages within a 15ft radius of the files. ARCHON systems were unable to process inputs related to the vehicle, rendering all commands inoperative for several minutes. The incident remains unresolved. The archived schematics and detailed reports on R-053 have been flagged for priority analysis.
