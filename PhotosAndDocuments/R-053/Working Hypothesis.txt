R-053 appears to induce a state of temporal stasis in regard to its construction, likely tied to its exposure to the energy released by the Ophyr Shard. Unlike other Remnants, which primarily exert psychological or emotional influence, R-053 traps its handlers in a loop of incompletion, as though the very concept of "finished" does not apply to it. This effect seems to escalate the longer an individual is involved with the project, with both physical and mental symptoms becoming more pronounced.

Additionally, the buggyâ€™s effect on nearby space suggests a form of spatial distortion localized to its presence. This phenomenon remains poorly understood, but early research indicates it may be connected to the mental fixation reported by those exposed to R-053.

**Further research is required**, especially regarding the theory that the psychological fixation may spread to unrelated projects once individuals have been involved with the buggy for extended periods. Recent cases involving team members abandoning their primary tasks to pursue unrelated "restoration" work point to a deeper, more pervasive effect that could extend beyond the immediate vicinity of the object.
