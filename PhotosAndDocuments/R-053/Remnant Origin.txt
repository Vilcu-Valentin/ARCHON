The object was exposed to the Strange Energy released by the Ophyr Shard event, which transformed it into a Remnant. It was once an ordinary buggy in the early stages of construction before the shard incident imbued it with its anomalous properties. Since the transformation, it has gained the ability to bind itself to those who interact with it, creating an ever-growing obsession that escalates over time.
