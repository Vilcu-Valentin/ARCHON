F-009 represents a form of localized **entropy acceleration**, though the exact mechanics remain unknown. It appears to target urban environments with high levels of pre-existing decay, suggesting that F-009 may be drawn to areas where entropy is already at work. Some researchers theorize that the wave functions like an amplifier for natural processes, drastically increasing the speed at which materials break down.

The use of radioactive isotopes in tracking F-009's activity has provided some insight into its nature, indicating that the wave interacts with matter on a subatomic level. This interaction results in a measurable, yet unexplained, increase in the rate of radioactive decay, which is otherwise unaffected by environmental factors.

Further research is required to determine whether F-009's dormancy can be sustained or if it will inevitably reappear. Preventative measures, including isotope-based detection systems, are in place to monitor for any signs of resurgence.
