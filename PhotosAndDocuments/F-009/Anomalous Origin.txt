The first known appearance of F-009 was documented in a coastal city in 1995, following a sudden and unexplained collapse of multiple industrial buildings. While initial investigations attributed the event to poor construction and environmental factors, further research revealed an underlying force responsible for the accelerated decay. Its origin remains unclear, though there is speculation that F-009 may be tied to broader environmental or atmospheric conditions, which could explain its selective manifestations in urban areas with high rates of decay.

F-009 is categorized as a **wave phenomenon**, and although dormant since 2001, it remains a subject of significant concern due to the unpredictability of its reappearance.
