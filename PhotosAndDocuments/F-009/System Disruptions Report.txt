ANNEX 

**[DATE REDACTED]**

During an archival process, data logs related to F-009 experienced a significant corruption event. Several entries regarding urban decay incidents were lost or altered, leading to gaps in the timeline of recorded occurrences. ARCHON systems identified the source of the corruption as external interference, potentially linked to residual waves that remain dormant. No confirmed activity of F-009 has been logged since 2001, though the decay anomalies continue to persist in localized forms.

**[DATE REDACTED]**

Several containment protocols were updated following F-009's dormancy to improve detection and early warning systems. ARCHON now requires all urban decay incidents exceeding expected rates to be cross-referenced with F-009 data. Modified isotope detection systems are now mandatory in regions previously affected by the anomaly.
