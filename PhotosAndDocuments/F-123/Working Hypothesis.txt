Chrono-Slip represents a unique force-based anomaly tied to time perception and reality distortion. Unlike other Remnants or anomalies that affect tangible objects or people directly, Chrono-Slip manipulates the fundamental flow of time itself within isolated pockets. These pockets can range from affecting one person in a brief moment of déjà vu, to larger anomalies that impact entire communities or regions.

Chrono-Slip events seem to have an inherent connection to sites of intense trauma or stress, suggesting that emotional or historical significance may trigger or amplify the anomaly. This correlation points to the possibility that Chrono-Slip is not entirely random but may be influenced by environmental or psychological factors.

The potential for widespread panic during large-scale Chrono-Slip events necessitates further research into both the psychological effects of repeated time loops and possible methods of containment. While the force does not appear to cause direct physical harm, its ability to disrupt social and psychological stability, particularly in already volatile areas, marks it as a growing concern.

Ongoing research focuses on developing predictive models to anticipate future large-scale Chrono-Slip occurrences and investigating possible containment measures to prevent mass hysteria during extended loops.
