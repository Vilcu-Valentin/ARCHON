ANNEX - Observational Data

“People were freaking out. It’s not like a normal déjà vu where you brush it off—everyone in the city woke up and realized it was the same day as yesterday. The radio stations played the same programs, shops restocked the same items, and events we remembered from the ‘day before’ were happening again, exactly the same way. We tried to change things, but no matter what, everything played out as if we hadn’t done anything differently. It was like the city was stuck in a time bubble.”
