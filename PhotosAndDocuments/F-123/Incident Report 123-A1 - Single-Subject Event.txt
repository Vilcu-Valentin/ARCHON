ANNEX - Observational Data

“I was walking down the street, and I had this overwhelming sense of déjà vu. But it wasn’t just a feeling—I could swear I’d already crossed the street and looked at my phone at the exact same time. The weird part is, I knew what was going to happen next. I saw a car drive by, the exact same car I’d seen before, and I knew that someone was going to honk their horn. It happened, just like I knew it would, and then everything went back to normal. It was like living a memory in real time.”
