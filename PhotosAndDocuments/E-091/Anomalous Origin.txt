The exact origin of E-091 is unknown, though it has been linked to shifts in atmospheric pressure and the unusual energy spikes following the Ophyr Shard event. The phenomenon was first documented in a series of reports during a record-breaking heatwave in 2011, though retroactive analysis has identified occurrences dating back decades.
