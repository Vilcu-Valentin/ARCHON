ANNEX - Observational Data

“At first, I thought it was just a mirage—temperatures were already sky-high—but when I moved closer, it felt like walking into a furnace. The air shimmered, bending the horizon behind it. We threw a heat sensor in, and it spiked, over 480°C. It was stationary, hovering like it was waiting for something, but no trace of the cause. Then, as quickly as it appeared, it dissipated, leaving nothing but normal heat behind.”
