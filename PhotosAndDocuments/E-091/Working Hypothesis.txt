E-091 seems to operate outside of conventional thermodynamic principles, producing localized heat spikes without an identifiable energy source. The lack of physical damage to the environment, despite temperatures reaching life-threatening levels, suggests a form of **non-physical heat**, possibly related to distortions in the local atmosphere or electromagnetic interference. 

Current hypotheses suggest a possible link between E-091 and **geomagnetic activity**, as well as anomalous interactions with the Earth's atmospheric layers. The fact that E-091 has been documented in both extreme heat and cold environments raises the possibility that it is not tied to any specific weather condition, but instead to **subtle shifts in the Earth's energy field**. Investigations are underway to determine whether E-091 is an emerging environmental threat or simply a side effect of larger atmospheric disruptions.

Recent tests have begun to explore the possibility that E-091 may be related to **spatial distortions**, which would explain the anomaly's self-contained heat and refraction properties. However, no conclusive data has been obtained, and the phenomenon remains one of ARF's top research priorities.
