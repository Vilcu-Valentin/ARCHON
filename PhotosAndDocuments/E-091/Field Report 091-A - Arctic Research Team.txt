ANNEX - Observational Data

“We expected this anomaly to pop up in deserts, heatwave zones, anywhere hot—but when it manifested here, in the middle of the arctic tundra, it changed everything. One second, the snow is blowing, the next, there’s this rippling bubble of heat. We measured 300°C, and yet we were standing just meters away, shivering. It lasted for a good hour, and then it just vanished.”
