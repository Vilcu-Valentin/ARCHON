E-023 seems to manipulate **human sensory perception** rather than environmental factors, producing an illusory experience of rainfall. Unlike traditional weather anomalies that can be measured and observed with meteorological tools, E-023 leaves no physical traces and cannot be detected by standard equipment. Its effect appears psychological in nature but manifests with such consistency that it suggests a deeper, possibly quantum-level disturbance in the perception of moisture.

The psychological toll on populations experiencing Phantom Rain is severe, especially in areas suffering from drought. The emotional weight of feeling rain without the benefit of water exacerbates existing crises, leading to widespread reports of **mental distress** and paranoia. Field researchers have noted an increase in these psychological effects the longer the anomaly persists in a region.

Some theories posit that E-023 may be related to localized disturbances in **ambient energy** fields, disrupting the way moisture is perceived rather than interfering with actual precipitation. This would explain why only certain individuals are affected and why reports vary even within small communities.

**Further research is required**, especially in understanding why Phantom Rain manifests primarily in drought-prone regions. The possible connection between environmental stressors and the onset of the anomaly is a growing area of interest, as researchers suspect that E-023 may be tied to **global shifts in water distribution**, reflecting the increasingly strained relationship between human populations and natural resources. As climate change continues to exacerbate drought conditions, it is likely that instances of E-023 will become more frequent, necessitating continued observation and analysis.
