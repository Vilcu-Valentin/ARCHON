**[DATE REDACTED]**

During efforts to analyze E-023â€™s meteorological impact, ARCHON systems experienced **data inconsistencies**. Equipment monitoring barometric pressure, humidity, and wind speed showed no signs of unusual activity, despite repeated reports from field agents that Phantom Rain had manifested during the tests. Further investigation revealed that **sensor arrays within the affected areas malfunctioned**, showing clear skies and normal atmospheric conditions even as subjects reported the sensation of rain.
