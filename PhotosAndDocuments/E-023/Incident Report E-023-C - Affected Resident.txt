“It’s cruel, you know? We’ve been praying for rain for months, and then this happens. You feel it, like it’s coming down hard, but when you check, your clothes are dry. I even saw my neighbors running inside with umbrellas. We’re all going mad out here. At first, we thought it was a blessing, but now... it’s just another nightmare. What kind of rain doesn’t get you wet?”
