ANNEX - Observational Data

"We arrived at the site after multiple reports of unusual rainfall in the area. Locals claimed they felt rain but never saw a drop. Initially, I was skeptical, but within minutes, I started feeling it too. I could feel cold raindrops hitting my skinâ€”my jacket was soaked, or at least it felt like it. But when I checked, I was dry. Everyone around me was touching their clothes and looking at the sky, but there was nothing there. No clouds, no moisture on the ground. Just the sensation that something was falling."
