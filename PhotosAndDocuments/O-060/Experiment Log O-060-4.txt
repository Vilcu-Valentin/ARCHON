ANNEX - Observational Data

"Researcher [REDACTED] entered the alternate room after the key was used on the same lock five consecutive times. Upon each entry, the room’s contents had changed progressively—new books appeared on the shelf, furniture became more misaligned, and the wallpaper color shifted slightly. On the fifth entry, an object resembling a door was found within the mirror’s reflection, which had not been present before. As per protocol, the door was closed after each entry. After the final closure, Researcher X was not able to be recovered. No further changes were observed in the room upon subsequent tests."
