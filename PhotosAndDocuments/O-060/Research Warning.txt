ANNEX

Individuals who enter these duplicate rooms are at risk of becoming trapped if the door closes behind them. No subject or research team has successfully returned from the alternate dimension once the door has shut. It is theorized that when the door closes, the connection to the original dimension is severed, and the trapped individuals remain isolated in the alternate space, unable to return. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that those trapped inside might continue opening doors in their new dimension, moving deeper into an unknown reality.
