ANNEX - Observational Data

"Subject D-214 entered the duplicate room after O-060 was used on a door in Test Site Alpha. Upon entry, the room appeared identical to the original, save for minor changesâ€”a chair that had shifted positions and a framed photo depicting a different background. Subject closed the door from the inside on command to test re-entry. After 30 minutes, when the door was reopened, no trace of the subject was found. It was as though the room had reset itself, with all furniture returned to its original position, and the photo restored to its initial state."
