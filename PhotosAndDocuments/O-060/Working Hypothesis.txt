O-060 demonstrates characteristics consistent with an **interdimensional object**, allowing temporary access to parallel or alternate versions of physical spaces. However, the exact nature of these dimensions remains speculative. Research suggests that these alternate rooms may not be entirely self-contained but rather represent **pocket realities** connected to a greater, more expansive alternate dimension. The possibility that individuals inside the duplicate rooms continue to explore new, deeper dimensions presents a significant risk for recovery.

It is also hypothesized that O-060’s alterations to the rooms may signify more than aesthetic changes, potentially reflecting shifts in the underlying dimensional structure or even the individual’s perception of reality itself. The extent to which these changes affect those trapped in the alternate dimension remains unknown, but reports of increasingly bizarre room modifications point to a progressive distortion of reality the longer the anomaly is used.

Current research aims to determine whether the phenomenon of **"Echoing"** (the recursive opening of doors within the alternate dimension) can be interrupted or reversed, though no method has been found to retrieve individuals once they become trapped.
