ANNEX

The transformation process has yet to be fully documented, but all instances of O-015 were standard mechanical clocks prior to their change. The anomaly primarily affects analog clocks, with no documented cases involving digital clocks or other time-keeping devices.

It appears the phenomenon may spread through prolonged exposure between clocks. Initial instances were discovered in a rural town after several residents reported losing time, eventually traced back to clocks in their homes. The anomaly does not appear to be tied to any specific geographical region, and instances have since been located in various urban and rural settings.
