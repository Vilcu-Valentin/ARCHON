O-015 appears to interact with the concept of **time perception**, distorting the subjective experience of time for those within its field of influence. Its origin remains speculative, but there is growing evidence that O-015 may represent a naturally occurring anomaly tied to the mechanics of time itself. The possibility that it is a **transmissible anomaly**, capable of spreading to other clocks, raises concerns about its containment and the broader implications of its effects on human cognitive functions.

Preliminary research into its self-repair mechanism suggests that O-015 operates on a closed temporal loop, wherein it resets itself to an earlier functional state. This theory remains unproven, but it aligns with the observed **temporal anomalies** experienced by personnel. Further investigation is required to understand the full scope of its influence on both living subjects and the physical environment.

Ongoing research into the psychological effects of O-015 has yielded evidence of **chronophobia** in affected individuals. These symptoms, combined with a loss of time and distorted memories, suggest the possibility that exposure to O-015 leads to a deeper disconnection from the conventional passage of time, which could have significant long-term consequences.
