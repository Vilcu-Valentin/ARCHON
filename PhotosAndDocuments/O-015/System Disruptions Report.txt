ANNEX 

**[DATE REDACTED]**

During an effort to catalog O-015's transmission patterns, ARCHON systems experienced an unexpected temporal lag, resulting in corrupted data logs and missing entries related to the anomaly. Multiple system errors were traced back to any file containing references to O-015, and staff members working near the anomaly reported confusion regarding the passage of time.

O-015 has since been placed under tighter observation, and containment protocols have been updated to include temporal dampeners. Affected staff are undergoing psychological evaluations for any long-term cognitive effects.
