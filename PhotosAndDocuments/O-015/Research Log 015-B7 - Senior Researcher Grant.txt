ANNEX - Observational Data

“We’ve seen multiple instances of people near O-015 reporting lost time. It’s subtle, almost like time is slipping through their fingers without them noticing. The clocks appear harmless at first, but after prolonged exposure, you start losing track of everything. One of our technicians claimed he had only been observing it for an hour, but the logs show he was sitting there for nearly six.”
