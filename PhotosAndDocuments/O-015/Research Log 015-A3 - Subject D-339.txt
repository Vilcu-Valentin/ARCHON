“I kept thinking it was broken because I didn’t hear anything, but when I checked, it was running perfectly. I sat there watching it for a while... it was strange. It’s like the room got quieter. I’d look away for just a second, and suddenly, the clock seemed like it was further along than it should’ve been. It felt like I’d been sitting there for maybe a minute, but the clock said it had been five. After a while, the silence gets... oppressive.”
