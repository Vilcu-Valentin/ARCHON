The cassette was first discovered by an ARF agent who had purchased a second-hand car in 1998. The tape was found inside the vehicle’s cassette player. Upon initial inspection, the cassette appeared to be blank, but further analysis revealed its endless playtime and the nature of the anomalous recordings.

The source of O-025’s anomaly remains unknown, though the content produced by the tape strongly hints at its connection to alternate realities or potential futures that diverged from our timeline. Despite thorough investigation, no other objects of a similar nature have been found, and O-025 remains the only known instance of its kind.
