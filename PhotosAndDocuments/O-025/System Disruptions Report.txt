**[DATE REDACTED]**

Multiple attempts to digitize or record O-025’s output have resulted in corrupted data, with audio files becoming scrambled or erased entirely within 24 hours of their creation. ARCHON systems experienced a partial lockdown when trying to upload digital copies of the tape’s recordings, with terminals freezing or producing error codes. Technicians report that all electronic copies related to O-025 degrade over time, suggesting that the tape's content may only exist in its original, analog form.

Additionally, several researchers have reported hearing distorted versions of the tape's audio after they had stopped listening to it, indicating potential auditory hallucinations or a residual psychological effect.
